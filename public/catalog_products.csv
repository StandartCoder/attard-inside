Specialty colours
The Rembrandt watercolour range includes various options for artists who love working with shimmering colours, like metallic, pearlescent and iridescent shades. Apply these colours in a thin layer to a dark watercolour paper or over a previously painted layer of watercolour for the best results.
Metallic colours are made using exclusive pearlescent pigments that do not oxidise, which helps preserve the colour over time. After drying, Rembrandt metallic colours look like a layer of precious metal that reflects the light beautifully.
Interference colours are pearlescent colours that allow you to add highlights and a pearlescent shine to any colour.
Chameleon colours shimmer and change colours depending on your viewing position or the light incidence.
Spark colours sparkle with an irregular sheen thanks to the subtle differences in size of the reflecting pigment particles.

Specialty colours
The Rembrandt watercolour range includes various options for artists who love working with shimmering colours, like metallic, pearlescent and iridescent shades. Apply these colours in a thin layer to a dark watercolour paper or over a previously painted layer of watercolour for the best results.
Metallic colours are made using exclusive pearlescent pigments that do not oxidise, which helps preserve the colour over time. After drying, Rembrandt metallic colours look like a layer of precious metal that reflects the light beautifully.
Interference colours are pearlescent colours that allow you to add highlights and a pearlescent shine to any colour.
Chameleon colours shimmer and change colours depending on your viewing position or the light incidence.
Spark colours sparkle with an irregular sheen thanks to the subtle differences in size of the reflecting pigment particles.

The Rembrandt watercolour range includes various options for artists who love working with shimmering colours, like metallic, pearlescent and iridescent shades. Apply these colours in a thin layer to a dark watercolour paper or over a previously painted layer of watercolour for the best results.
Metallic colours are made using exclusive pearlescent pigments that do not oxidise, which helps preserve the colour over time. After drying, Rembrandt metallic colours look like a layer of precious metal that reflects the light beautifully.
Interference colours are pearlescent colours that allow you to add highlights and a pearlescent shine to any colour.
Chameleon colours shimmer and change colours depending on your viewing position or the light incidence.
Spark colours sparkle with an irregular sheen thanks to the subtle differences in size of the reflecting pigment particles.

The more water you use, the lighter the colour of the paint becomes. As a result, you can work with many transparent layers on top of one another to create beautiful colour effects.

AMS1263,Product,Oil Colour 60 ml Titanium White (Safflower Oil) 105,"This Rembrandt oil paint has been developed through pure skill and artistic insight and is based on the best raw materials. This assortment of extra-fine quality oil colours boasts a uniform viscosity and are crafted with a high concentration of premium-quality pigments that offer the highest degree of lightfastness. Rembrandt oil colourOil paint with a buttery consistency for a clear brush stroke.Ground multiple times on a triple roller mill to create artist quality fineness.Made with high concentrations of pigments that offer excellent lightfastness.Available in 120 very pure and intense colours, including 58 mono-pigmented colours.Skilfully crafted in the Netherlands since 1899.WhitesRembrandt offers a selection of whites with different properties and applications. Zinc White: A semi-opaque cool white. Makes colours lighter without weakening the original colour. Available based on safflower oil (104) for the top layer and linseed oil (117) for lower layers. Titanium White: An opaque, warm white. Great for toning down intense colours and creating opaque mixing shades. Available based on safflower oil (105) for the top layer and linseed oil (118) for lower layers.Mixed White: A neutral white. Contains both zinc and titanium pigments. Based on safflower oil.Transparent White: A transparent white. Lightens transparent colours, great for glazing techniques. Based on safflower oil.Pearl White: A transparent white that adds an iridescent sheen. Works best when mixed with transparent colours. Based on safflower oil.Linseed vs. safflower oilBesides the pigments used, the binder also impacts the paint's properties. As linseed oil shows some yellowing over time, it is sometimes replaced by safflower oil, particularly for white paint. Safflower oil is less yellowing, so it is great for use in the top layers of your painting, but it dries more slowly. Safflower oil is therefore less suitable for thickly painted areas or lower paint layers. For the lower layers, we recommend using a white based on linseed oil.",cb807d_b40f22f1612742479d91c4c7f9c8d478~mv2.png;cb807d_536c506cf6d64b76890fa7852cebed5a~mv2.jpg,Paints;Oil;REMBRANDT,TA01061052,,13.1,,true,PERCENT,0.0,9,,2.98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,REMBRANDT

AMS2527,Product,Painting Paste 087 Tube 60 ml,"Cobra Painting Paste is a colourless medium that can be mixed with Cobra oil paint in any ratio. The paste is as thick as the paint and can therefore be described as a water-mixable oil paint without any pigment. This paste is composed of vegetable oils and thickening agents and has various uses.
 
Increasing the amount of paint:
This painting paste can be used for impasto techniques (applying pure paint in thick strokes with a painting knife) using more expensive colours, so you can increase the amount of paint without there being difference in colour. The more paste you add, the more transparent the paint becomes. The painting paste also allows thick paint to dry completely to the core, preventing wrinkling or rippling during and after drying.
Decreasing the colour intensity:
The colour intensity of the paint will decrease as more painting paste is added. This may be particularly important with the alla prima (wet-on-wet) technique when mixing colours with a highly divergent colour intensity with one another in your painting. By adding more painting paste to a stronger colour, this becomes less prominent.
 
Properties:
Increases the transparency and thickness of the paint.
Prevents wrinkling of thick layers of paint.
Retains the degree of gloss.
Can be thinned with water.
Does not influence the drying time of the paint.
Increases the durability of the paint film.

How to transfer images:
Apply a layer of the transfer medium on the printed side of your laser-printed image or on the surface you will be working on. Note that the image will be mirrored when transferred, so if you want to work with text, don’t forget to mirror the image first. Put the printed side of the paper down onto the surface you’re working on, press down firmly and carefully rub away any air bubbles. Allow to dry for at least 24 hours. Moisten the paper with water using a moist cloth or sponge. Use your fingers or a cloth to rub off all the paper, to reveal the transferred image.

AMS2587,Product,Acrylic Varnish 115 Matt Spray Can 400 ml,"Protect your work from dust, dirt and other external influences with Amsterdam acrylic varnishes. Make your work last and give it the protection it deserves. Amsterdam varnishes come in spray cans and bottles and are available in matt, satin, gloss and high gloss finishes (high gloss is only available in a bottle). These varnishes provide a durable, flexible, reversible and non-yellowing seal to not only acrylic paintings, but oil paintings as well!Before you varnish, take the following into account:Ensure the varnish and your painting are at room temperature during application and drying. If they are not, a white cast may appear on your work, since changes in temperature can cause condensation under the layer of varnish.Shake well before use. Apply the varnish in a thin layer, holding the spray can approximately 40 cm from your work. Only use the varnish in a well-ventilated room.Make sure to apply varnish in a single layer only. Multiple layers may cause inconsistencies in sheen.Amsterdam acrylic varnishApply when paint film has dried completely (4 to 5 days with normal film thickness).Shake well before use.Dries in a few hours.Does not yellow.Can be thinned with white spirit.Extremely flammable.Dry varnish layers can be removed with white spirit.",12340a_36b57c9eccf341ec80661b35715ccc4f~mv2.png,Auxiliaries;Varnishes & fixatives;AMSTERDAM,TA95168115,,17.82,,true,PERCENT,0.0,9,,6.08,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMSTERDAM
